## Proposal Sections & Checklist

### 1. Introduction/Background
Provide an introduction of your topic and literature review of related work. Briefly explain your dataset and its features, and provide a link to the dataset if possible.

- **Literature Review**  
- **Dataset Description**  
- **Dataset Link**

### 2. Problem Definition
Identify a problem and motivate the need for a solution.

- **Problem**  
- **Motivation**  

### 3. Methods
Present proposed solutions including specific data processing methods and machine learning algorithms, and elaborate on why you think each will be effective. It is recommended to identify specific functions/classes in existing packages and libraries (i.e. scikit-learn) rather than coding the algorithms from scratch.

- **3+ Data Preprocessing Methods**  
- **3+ ML Algorithms/Models**  
- Supervised **or** Unsupervised Learning Methods Identified (Supervised is recommended)

### 4. (Potential) Results and Discussion
Identify several quantitative metrics you plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics). Present goals in terms of these metrics, and state any expected results.

- **3+ Quantitative Metrics**  
- **Project Goals** (recommended to include sustainability and ethical considerations)  
- **Expected Results**

### 5. References
Cite relevant papers and articles utilizing the IEEE format. All references in this section must have a matching in-text citation in the body of your proposal text.

- **3+ References** (preferably peer reviewed)  
- **1+ In-Text Citation Per Reference**
